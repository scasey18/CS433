## Running the test
1. Navigate to the location of the compiled "uab_sh" executable
2. Run the program using the command "./uab_sh"

## How to run test cases
Follow Running the Test instructions and then follow the individual commands in each test case

### Sample test cases
1. Open a session using "./uab_sh"
